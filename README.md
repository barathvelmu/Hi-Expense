# Hi-Expense: Financial Management Software ðŸ’°

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository of Hi-Expense, a personal financial management software! 

*This project was purely built using Python, Django, JavaScript, Chart.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, and CSS.* 

The purpose of this software is to make personal finance management 10x simpler. Some features of this project include

- end-to-end authentication: register, login, and password reset functionality
- adding, deleting, and updating of expense entries (CRUD)
- adding, deleting, and updating of income entries (CRUD)
- ajax search functionality: search by "source", "amount", "category", "description", "date", and more
- pagination of up to 10 income/expense entries per page
- export capability to CSV, Excel, and/or PDF (dynamic)
- responsive expense chart for data visualization
- setting of different currencies: over 100 currencies available

## What is the goal of this project?
I wanted to built and end-to-end application with a frontend, backend, and database. I chose to build Hi-Expense with Python (Django) and JavaScript as they allow for easier implementation of certain functionality such as authentication, and search. 
I also picked up JavaScript in the Summer of 2021. This project let me further explore the power of it.
